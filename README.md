# Medical-Insurance-Prediction
This project predicts the cost of medical insurance using a linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset of medical insurance claims from Kaggle.

## Getting Started
To run the project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
Once you have installed the libraries, you can run the Jupyter Notebook.



## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the test set. This means that the model correctly predicts the cost of medical insurance 85% of the time.
